ALIGNED WEB APP - HOW IT WORKS

1. GENERAL OVERVIEW
-------------------
The app is built using:
- Frontend: Next.js (a React framework that makes web apps fast and user-friendly)
- Payment System: Stripe (handles all money and subscription stuff safely)
- Backend: Next.js API Routes (handles communication between our app and Stripe)

When someone uses the app:
1. They see subscription plans on the main page
2. Click a plan
3. Enter their email
4. Enter payment details
5. Get access to the service

2. ABOUT THE 500 ERRORS
-----------------------
A 500 error means something went wrong on our server. This usually happens because:
- The app can't talk to Stripe properly
- Some important settings are missing
- The payment information isn't correct

To fix this, we need to:
- Double-check all our Stripe settings
- Make sure all required information is being sent correctly
- Add better error messages to help users understand what went wrong

3. POPUP CUSTOMIZATION
----------------------
There are actually two different popups in the payment flow:

First Popup (We control this one):
- This is our custom popup where users enter their email
- We can change anything about this popup (colors, text, buttons)
- Currently shows "Select payment method" - we can change this to "Securely pay"
- We can make the button green instead of blue

Second Popup (Stripe's popup):
- This is Stripe's payment form
- We can only change some basic things like colors
- This is for security - Stripe handles sensitive payment data

4. EXIT OFFER POPUP
------------------
Yes! We can add a special offer popup when someone tries to leave. It would:
- Show up when clicking the X button
- Display a special trial offer ($9.99 deal)
- Show the comparison graph
- Include the money-back guarantee
- Give them another chance to subscribe

This is a good way to convince unsure customers by:
- Offering a better deal
- Showing the value they'll get
- Reducing their risk with a guarantee

5. DISCOUNTED PRICING
--------------------
The discount system works like this:

First Month:
- Customer pays the discounted price (like $0.05 or $9.99)
- This is a one-time special price

Second Month Onwards:
- Automatically switches to full price
- Customer pays regular price (like $39.99)
- This continues monthly until cancelled

This is all handled automatically by Stripe's subscription system. The customer knows upfront that:
- First month is discounted
- Regular pricing starts from second month
- They can cancel anytime

All payment processing is secure and automated - customers don't need to do anything for the price change to happen.
